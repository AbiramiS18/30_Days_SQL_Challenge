# 30_Days_SQL_Challenge

This repository documents my journey through a 30-day SQL challenge, where I tackled a wide range of SQL problems each day to sharpen my database skills. The challenge covers fundamental to advanced topics such as SELECT queries, JOIN operations, subqueries, window functions, and performance optimization. Each day's solution is designed to be clear and efficient, with explanations provided for complex queries. This challenge is ideal for those looking to build a strong foundation in SQL or refine their query writing abilities.
